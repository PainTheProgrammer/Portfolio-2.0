                        <span class="list-heading">Problem Solving</span> - Creating solutions for issues in my life 
                        has always been an integral part of who I am. 
                        I love to come up with creative ways to get around troubles that I come across, 
                        and trying to find the most effecient way to solve it.

                        <span class="list-heading">IT</span> - Since a young boy I always had a love for computers. 
                        I had my own PC at a young age, and was playing games, creating word documents, exploring the web. 
                        I was naturally drawn to it in school and took GCSE Computer Science. Then followed that up with a year in college, doing a diploma in ICT. Unfortunately, 
                        I made a mistake trying to do something else and left my IT days in the past. But i've finally built up the courage to pursue my true passion.

                        <span class="list-heading">People Skills</span> - A lot of my professional roles have been in some form of customer service. 
                        This has enabled to gain solid communication skills and helps me build rapport with customers.

                        <span class="list-heading">Video Games</span> - I grew up playing video games from a young age, as a boy that was never into sports much. 
                        Playing games was my way of being competitive. 
                        I love playing team based games like League of Legends and Valorant as they fulfill my competitive nature.

                        but after a few jobs I realised what I do and don't like in a role. 
                        After doing some research and self-analysis, I realised that software development would be the perfect job for me. 
                        So know I study hard everyday to step closer to my dream job.

                        What is the point of living if you aren't happy? 
                        Where happiness comes from, that i'm still trying to figure out but I know it's something I should strive towards everyday.

                <p>
                    I was tasked with a project to create an interesting looking website page, 
                    I used canva to create an intended layout and design for the website, 
                    and then transfered the ideas to an actual functioning and responsive website.
                    This is still a WIP currently.
